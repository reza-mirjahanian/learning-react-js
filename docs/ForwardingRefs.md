# Forwarding Refs

Ref forwarding is a technique for automatically passing a  [ref](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html)  through a component to one of its children. This is typically not necessary for most components in the application. However, it can be useful for some kinds of components, especially in reusable component libraries.
