"The concept of render hijacking is the ability to control what a component will output from another component". It actually means that you decorate your component by wrapping it into a Higher-Order component. By wrapping you can inject additional props or make other changes, which can cause changing logic of rendering. It does not actually "ENABLES" hijacking, but by using HOC you make your component behave in different way.
